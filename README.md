# BasicCalculator
BasicCalculator asks user for two numbers, and is able to perform one of four operations:

- add
- subtract
- multiply
- divide.
It also prints taken action to the console. If sign prompted by the user was sth else than +, -, * or /, the result is being set to 0.

It was for me first time using enhanced 'switch', and gotta say - really, really handy.
